-- Paper: Veena Kochat\*, AT Raman\* et al., [*Acta Neuropathologica* (2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00401-021-02341-z)

-- Dataset: [GSE141439](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE141439). The GEO repository consists of all the fastq and processed files such as raw fastq (sequence files), raw counts table, list of differentially expressed genes (output from DESeq2) and bigWig/peak files (for IGV visualization).

-- Here is the **pipeline** for the analysis of [ChIPseq dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/819971) (developed by [Ming Tang](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/ChIP-seq-analysis))
